== Description ==

CTLG is a free, responsive WordPress block theme specifically designed for creating lists, directories, and catalogs. It comes with a variety of pre-designed templates and four distinct style variations. Its index template features a full-width header, followed by a right-aligned query loop where you can display blog posts or pages, and a simple full-width footer. Its post and page templates follow the same layout.

* Fix Content Options featured images on Pages\n
* Comment styling improvements\nFixed some formatting issues with comments, namely adding a separator between each main comment, and adjusting margins accordingly. Also changed the targeting for comment width so that 660px applies to the entire .comments-area instead of individual sections.
* Added margin-bottom to blockquotes (in the event that there is no <p> inside the blockquote)\n
* Change margins on post containers and title to improve readability\n
* Added word-wrap property to .entry-title to break long words on mobile\n

This approach felt hacky anyway, so I fixed the styles so that .entry-content was fixed at 660px and .size-big images have a negative margin at 1000px and larger.

That post class filter was way complicated and fragile and whatever anyway, and was basically me trying to follow the rules and NOT put the class in post_class like I'm supposed to, and I later needed to put stuff directly in the function anyway, so, whatever, I'm just putting the pique-panel class directly into the function, and if anyone doesn't like it you are welcome to spend the six hours testing edge cases that's required to make this work correctly.\nIn short: fixed stuff, doesn't make me crazy, makes code less hairy. Yay!

* If a user has selected a static front page for their site, don't display a "No results" message if no posts are found. Fixes #2928\n
* Apply fix to toggle menu script, loading it when the dom is ready rather than when the window loads; this prevents a bug where users on mobile devices like iPhone can't open the menu when other media is present on the page. Fixes #2888\n

= 5 March 2015 =
* Move theme out of the dev directory.\n
* Add theme to ignored themes list.\n
* Clean-up.\n
* Fade images to black-and-white on hover, just for a little extra oomph.\nThis may need a bit of browser prefixing, but should degrade quite gracefully where support doesn't exist.
* I don't think we need to set a min-height on the site-branding area unless there is no site title displayed; this causes weird spacing issues in the header when a site title is present.\n
* Tweak for height of site branding area when a custom header is assigned; See #2872\n
* Improvements to custom headers on mobile devices. Fixes #2872\n
* Make sure $content_width's default is set to the widest necessary value to avoid videos and other media being shown at a too-small width. This doesn't appear to negatively effect other media, such as tiled galleries, that are displayed at the narrower width. Fixes #2987\n
* Allow videos to expand to the full size of the column rather than restricted to 460px; Fixes #2940\n
* Additional improvements to comment form field styles on small screens\n
* Don't let textareas and inputs overflow the content container. Fixes #2866\n
* Fix bug introduced in r24493 where site title and tagline were hidden from view when a custom header image was added. Fixes #3004\n

* Ensure Gravatar hovercards appear above comment content; Fixes #2918\n
* Add wrapper link to site header allowing sites without a displayed site title or description to still link to the home page with their custom header. Fixes #2790\n
* Use sprintf() rather than printf() for search and tag archives strings; since we're echoing the value, we want sprintf(). printf() was outputting the number of characters in the string after the string. Fixes #2831\n
* Move color options/search script from header.php into the main scripts file and localize it, so Search text is available for translation; Fixes #3000\n
* Site title size tweak\n

* Wrap social link text in screen-reader-text classes so it doesn't show in some browsers; Fixes #2945\n

* Remove widont filter around entry titles on home/archive pages. Fixes #2856\n
* Fix submenu touch taps for small screens/tablets; fixes #2969\n
* This theme requires at least 4.1\n
* Adjust editor styles so there isn't an awkward-feeling margin at the top.\n
* Add custom description to the tagline control because it's hidden in this theme.\n
* If the sidebars aren't active, use a slender overall page width (for desktops) and have the primary column span the full width.\nThis make the design look properly balanced (and a bit more elegant) if the sidebars are all empty. I could see users opting for this out-of-the-gate, as it does feel substantially less busy.
* Move custom header image out of masthead.\n
* Remove console.log output.\n(Whoops.)
* Add a body class when a custom menu is active.\n
* Minor tweak to margin; needs an extra pixel.\n
* Adjust right margin on recent posts widget :before elements so two+ line titles don't look off. Fixes #2955\n
* Add latin-ext characters to the theme fonts so more languages are supported. Fixes #2951\n
* Use margins rather than padding on entry meta to prevent overlapping the entry title; fixes #2999\n
* Sanitize $_GET callback, fixing XSS error and preventing old browsers from exploiting JSONP with Rosetta Flash.\n
* A new screenshot.\n
* Add missing width value.\n
* Let user have non uppercase site title as default.\n
* Style tweak\n
* Show main navigation as default on large screen.\n
* Rewrite main JS to use jQuery.\nUsing JS was a noble goal, but ultimately browser inconsistencies starting making everything fall apart, and I don't need to be reinventing the wheel when something can be achieved much more simply using an existing library (that's rather likely to be loaded in most WordPress installations, anyway.) This solves the problem of the grid breaking in Chrome, as well as some odd refreshing/page-flash issues that were cropping up.

* adding/fixing styles for WP.com widgets\n

= 3 March 2015 =
* WP.com style\n
* Ensure there are sufficient margins on the site-branding area for small screens + long site titles/descriptions. Fixes #2958\n
* Allow Tonesque to calculate contrast and add color to Image format posts for oEmbed images (Flickr, for example) by first applying filters to the content before passing it to the regex function. Props @kathrynwp for providing the fix! Fixes #2852\n
* Ensure reply title font family matches with the rest of the theme. Fixes #2847\n
* Fix mismatched text domain. Fixes #2997\n
* Ensure that height of featured post sans featured image is equivalent to height of all other post images/boxes.\n
* Ensure site branding area (like logo, site title) is abled to be clicked on small screens by setting a higher z-index, so it's not overlapped by the site navigation. Fixes #2963\n
* Remove star-toggle if Infinite Scroll is enabled.\nWhile this is a nice functionality, it's confusing from a UX perspective when Infinite Scroll is enabled, mostly because you end up booted back to the front page, rather than the IS "page" you were actually on when you clicked on the star button. I spent a little bit of time wrestling with pagination & page URLs in order to determine a sane way of generating the URL for the toggle, but there doesn't seem to be a great solution right now, short of rewriting this code entirely. In the interests of "getting things done", I'm just going to disable this feature if IS is active for now.
* Ensure main navigation submenus appear above higher z-indexed items (like the slideshow gallery) on large screens. Fixes #2965\n
* Add styling for Fieldset/Legend elements to better match the theme\n
* Add bottom margin to Latest Posts post titles so two-line titles don't get hidden behind the next section. Fixes #2971, props to @kathrynwp for the fix\n
* Rewind_posts() in the header when calling up the author archives to avoid the first post being lost due to using it to display the author name as the page title. Fixes #2977\n
* Style captions to look more like the theme in the editor styles; Fixes #2954\n
* Simplify front-page.php template by combining multiple variables into one variable each, then ensure there's an error message displayed to the user when they've hidden all sections on the front page; this error message is more useful than a black screen. Fixes #2973\n
* Make blog post-link selector more specific to avoid bug where reblogs inherited the .post-link styles and mangled the display; Fixes #2976\n
* Check for the presence of an iFrame in the .entry-content selector before removing that selector; this was preventing iFrames, like Google Calendar, from appearing on their own in the content area. Fixes #2978\n
* Update widget area names for clarification; they're not "sidebars" they're "widget areas". See #2979\n
* Ensure separator appears on single posts between author and post date; swap content: none for content: "" since "none" isn't a supported property in all browsers. Fixes #2980\n
* Add edit links to pages. Fixes #2981\n
* Comment out theme-specific PollDaddy styles that were breaking the look of non-plain polls. Fixes #2983\n
* Ensure sharing by email box has a high enough z-index to be usable; Fixes #2984\n
* Added readme.txt file\n
* Added languages folder and hew.pot file\n
* Style thumbnail galleries into columns. Fixes #2998\n
* Echo "Your comment is waiting moderation" string, fixes #2991\n
* Ensure that featured posts use proportions that match standard posts. (Use 2x size in order to better accomodate Retina devices.)\nIncreased font size for featured posts' entry-meta is too subtle——let's just stick with the same size and placement as regular posts.
* Remove border around table element for Flickr widget; Fixes #2996\n
* Correct Customizer preview so it automatically shows the proper colours for title & description in the header.\nSince there's no default set (on purpose), clearing the style should remove all colour overrides from the inline style and revert back to the original style declared in the stylesheet. Applying the colour to the site-title a ensures that it's applied correctly.
* Add some extra side-padding to buttons.\n

= 27 February 2015 =
* tweaked jetpack infinite scroll footer\n
* Moved posts pagination to footer, changed prev/next to arrow\n
* Apparently hiding the updated class hides the whole publish date\n
* Cleaned up/styled 404 and content-none, tinkered with infinite scroll footer\n
* Added editor styles and rtl styles, wpcom styles, custom header styles, some cleanup\n
* Old TODO cleanup: remove superfluous body classes, and explain the addition of extra post classes.\n
* Ensure that editor styles are being loaded correctly, and that custom fonts appear.\n
* Remove custom colour functionality, at least for now.\nSince this relies on a user-defined accent colour, this is largely irrelevant in WordPress.com.
* Add proper readme documentation and update tags to reflect current theme.\nReadme could probably use some copyedits at a later stage—the description is a bit bland and awkward still, but my brain is frozen.
* Ensure captioned images display correctly after infinite scroll loads; only apply special caption styles to images that meet certain height/width requirements, rather than using a CSS selector to determine the style.\n
* Themed comments, added prettier excerpt more, changed plural/singular title classes and styles\n
* Added header image, adjusted featured image size\n
* Ensure that menus are always clickable/hoverable.\nWhen the two menus overlapped on smaller screens, sometimes nothing would be clickable, rendering the menus useless.
* Ensure that site logo has some bottom margin, otherwise it'll run into the navigation.\n
* Simplify and re-implement the Customizer, and add ability to turn off author bio panel on posts.\nI'm removing all the custom colour functionality for now, in the interests of not getting all conflicty with WordPress.com's own Custom Colours functionality.
* For portrait-oriented mobile devices, increase the space between the site title and site description.\nBoth elements are extremely likely to span two lines within this available size, so they'll look better with more spacing between them.
* Carets for sub-sub-category drop-downs were slightly misaligned on IE9. This fixes that.\n
* Add image.php for image attachments, so users can navigate through attached images more elegantly.\n
* Moved singular/plural classes to body class\n
* Tweaked post formats, styled footer, cleaned up css\n

= 26 February 2015 =
* Add support for infinite scroll directly to theme; fixes #2863\n
* Final RTL tweaks.\nThis is a bunch of little changes: adjusting post articles to float right, rather than right, and moving the entry-meta to overlap to the right. Moving the sidebar to the right. Making sure drop-down menus behave as expected. Moving comment avatar and search button to opposite sides, as appropriate.
* Hide hidden items to the right, rather than to the left, right RTL locales.\n
* Swap main navigation with social for RTL locales, move logo to right-hand side, and tweak line spacing of header text for better display.\n
* Themed header and nav\n
* Reverse pagination arrows for RTL locales.\n
* Add basic RTL styles.\n
* Remove datetime attribute from post permalink so as to comply with WC3 validator.\nThe time & date are already available for microformats, etc, via the <time> stamp so we shouldn't need to have this attached to the link itself anymore.
* Use global print styles.\nI always prefer to write my own print styles, but for this theme I suspect few would be printing it anyway, so it's not a high priority.
* Reduce the size of h1s on teensy (mobile) screens for better legibility. Correct overflow bug produced by negative margins on post pagination carets.\n
* Make sure JS for mobile menu doesn't run until the page is fully loaded.\n
* Tweaked meta, worked on post formats\n
* Add proper support for Infinite Scroll.\nHide the pagination menu if IS is loaded.
* Improve grid layout of posts.\nI'm removing Masonry for the moment—it's causing too many conflicts and I'm not sure I like it visually anymore.
* Fixed date in changelog\n
* Added comments template back in to content-single.php, some CSS cleanup\n
* correcting the following: * updating the content width so it matches actual content area * fixing social link location in readme.txt\n
* Updates for the following design fixes: * Moving navigation into header and updating styles to run across width of site * Updating header background size for small screens so it won't get blown out when menu is open * Moving entry-meta text styles to the correct section * Removing semi-transparent background from content area\n
* comment markup formatting was causing the date link and edit link to appear to run together - adjusting to fix\n
* belatedly adding portfolio-page template update with new navigation so pagination works for porfolio projects\n
* Functions required in content.php and content-single.php\n
* Styled and adjusted markup on post contents, including video, audio, and image formats\n

= 25 February 2015 =
* Add basic custom header functionality.\nI think the theme actually works better without one, but this seems to be a function that a lot of people are looking for (https://wordpress.org/support/topic/header-image-116, https://wordpress.org/support/topic/how-would-i-add-a-responsive-full-with-header-image), and it doesn't hurt to add it.
* Add support for site logos.\nThis looks sharp and
* "Link" post formats should link directly to said link from archive pages.\nThis
* Fine-tune spacing of entry-meta on archive pages.\n
* If our post doesn't use a featured image, show the post format icon in its grid box.\nThis adds some visual interest to the page as well as some usability. It could easily be extended to posts with featured images by showing the icon on top of the image itself, but I don't think that's necessary here, and may take away from the images themselves.
* Fixed site header being cut off on mobile, when no header image present; Fixes #2793\n
* Move pagination outside of #main on archive pages.\nThis ensures that pagination clears the grid correctly. (Same problem as #23839.)
* Remove placeholder images for posts without featured images, and use CSS styles instead.\nThis sets us up to use some custom styling for different post formats, which will add interest to the page if a user hasn't uploaded many featured images.
* Replacing the_posts_navigation() from _s  with one following Sketch's formatting -- it has to be possible to pass the navigation function the max number of pages for it to work on Porfolio pages\n

= 24 February 2015 =
* Fixed google fonts call, started digging into layout\n
* Fix gallery float issue when 4 columns\n
* Tweak display of sidebar.\nEnsure that sidebar clears in mobile and tablet views, where we're using a single-column layout. Tweak a few elements based on Monster Widget testing. Since we're here anyway, we'll also adjust padding of articles on mobile screen sizes so that the page doesn't overlap the viewport.
* Ensure that search widget input spans full width.\n
* Added headline styles\n
* Removing from .ignore\n
* Add readme.txt in preparation for submission to .org\n
* Add theme description in preparation for launch.\n
* Move toggled menu icon to fix to the top of the site header, so we don't get jumpiness from it moving back to the top on close\n
* Move menu toggle button to bottom of menu when opened\n
* Add search.php file.\nThis should have been added with #23837, except that I'm a moron and forgot to add it properly.
* Allow asides to show title on archive pages.\nFor some reason, the entry titles were being hidden on archive pages for aside post types. I can't think of a good reason for doing that——it
* Remove the min-height set on the primary sidebar.\nI don't know why it was there, but it
* Move pagination outside of #main div.\nThis will ensure that the pagination always clears the grid of posts.
* Write some jQuery to take into account linked captioned images to style them if full size or large size\n
* Make sure that we show a title on the search page, otherwise people will get confused. Implement post display as a grid on search results pages, same as in archive pages.\nAdditionally, we're using <section> for the #primary div, both to fall in line with _s and for increased code legibility. (Fewer </div> tags at the end of a page = happier code-maintainers.)
* Rebuild index.php using _s as a base.\nPrevious version was adding some outdated and unnecessary CSS classes, as well as manually writing out the page titles. We're going to follow the _s model for consistency instead.
* Tweak design of 404 page so it's more useful.\nThis arranges the page in two columns for tablets-sized devices and larger. It also aligns the search box more sensibly, and ensures that font sizes are set to match the widgets in the sidebar.
* Adjust line height on Rate This text\n
* Adjustments to buttons and form fields to make them easier to see\n
* Minor improvements to Author widget styles\n
* Add wpcom-specific styles\n
* Ensure nested blockquotes don't inherit the before and after pseudo-elements\n
* Specify font size on Genericons so they don't change size when body font changes in Custom Fonts\n
* Update custom header fonts enqueue function to use admin_enqueue_scripts with a $hook_suffix conditional, rather than admin_print_scripts\n
* Remove unnecessary title tag in header.php; Minnow now supports title-tag\n
* Add theme support for title-tag and include a shiv for backwards compatibility\n
* updating format quote styles; found lack of bottom margin doesn't work with Share links on WP.com\n
* Added genericons, added Google Fonts to inc.php, modified css structure\n
* Add custom class to post_class() of 'has-post-thumbnail' when it's a password protected post with a featured image. Fixes #2967\n
* making navigation styles more general for different menus\n
* Trigger a screen resize when opening the sidebar to make sure that the gallery widget is being displayed\n
* Trigger a screen resize when opening the sidebar to make sure that the gallery widget is being displayed. Fixes #2970\n
* making respond form styles more specific\n
* Fix page-header issue on archive/search page when unfixed header theme option is ticked\n
* Adding styles for no-results on portfolio - realized issue when created demo site\n
* moving theme from dev directory into main /pub directory\n
* Adding to .ignore\n
* Update style.css and readme for submission to .org\n

= 23 February 2015 =
* Tweak styling of form elements.\nThis could still use some colour tweaking, but I'm saving that until I deal with the site colours as a whole.
* Minor visual/spacing tweaks to comment navigation.\n
* Tweak spacing of tags and categories for multi-line lists. Ensure that author bio text lines up with edges of grid.\n
* Use sans-serif typeface for in-post pagination and space links out a bit.\n
* Improve styling of comments.\n
* Sandbox 1.6.2: Add inactive header for theme retirement.\n
* merge with latest core changes up to [wp31501].\n
* merge with latest core changes up to [wp31500].\n
* Add support for more social networks\n
* Remove unnecessary author setup function, since we're using new archive title and description functions; switch to updated version of wp_title shim\n
* Tweak image alignments.\n
* Update version number and readme in preparation for .org submission\n
* Align galleries to overall site grid.\nWe're using a custom gutter width here just to keep the elements relatively closely spaced, rather than the slightly larger gutters used for the rest of the site as a whole. I've also centre-aligned the captions and have styled them a smidge.
* Fix bug in IE 11 where content overlapped sidebar area when active; use Normalize instead of reset, reverse media queries, fix minor typo in index.php comment\n

= 21 February 2015 =
* adding more space above page comments; setting footer width to match content area - basically trying to improve two odd spots in the theme\n
* swapping in new archive title and description functions. Adding styles to clear posts to post navigation\n
* switching to new post/pagination navigation core functions; copied code and fallbacks from _s. Updating throughout theme and updating classes used in styles.\n
* only displaying comments_template if comments are open; lifted logic from _s\n
* adding genericon.css; adding genericon font to site through functions rather than @import in stylesheet; removing @import in styles and updating numbering\n
* was using esc_url with get_permalink when the_permalink would have worked fine; swapped the former for the latter\n
* moving styles that don't need to be inline in the header to the stylesheet - they don't change, so can be with other static styles\n
* updating portfolio tags, type lists so the formatting - space and colon - were no longer in the string that was being translated before each list\n
* removing unneeded custom image size function; moving add editor styles to setup function to avoid using init; removing loading inc/wpcom\n
* renaming theme customization panel to Theme to match standard\n
* removing language files that were included with the theme, since they will be regenerated before launch\n
* removing @since from all files; from Caroline's feedback\n

= 20 February 2015 =
* Clean up functions.php; add editor styles\n
* Add languages files; rename sidebar areas to make more sense, since they're not really sidebars, but widget areas\n
* Remove text-decoration from pseudo-elements for IE\n
* Force site title to be white when Custom Headers/Featured Images are present, using a class on the body tag; add screenshot\n
* Add RTL styles\n
* Add top margin to entry meta\n
* Try using the correct selector. >:(\n
* Try hiding menu with display: none and activating with block to see if that fixes the touchscreen problem\n
* Oops; add the necessarily .focus style for touch devices.\n
* Another attempt to fix submenu display for touch devices\n
* Better padding/styles/alignment for submenus; attempt to fix touchscreen bug where submenus can't be accessed\n
* Update link colors; add touchscreen solution for drop-down menus\n

= 19 February 2015 =

* Add tags to style.css\n
* Remove outline in widget area inputs since we have a dark outline border applied\n
* Add visited link styles for footer\n
* Adjust post bottom margin for smaller screens\n
* Use bullets instead of raquos for bulleted lists in the navigation and widget areas\n
* Revert theme support for title-tag; too complicated to override Minnow's settings. If we want to add support for the title tag, it should be done via the parent theme, Minnow\n
* Style inputs in widgets to avoid background color conflict; style menu toggle color when on to have more contrast\n
* minor fixes for social links when custom header image is active; fix for tables in widgets\n

* updating readme social link spelling to fix CodePen, Polldaddy, typos (found out about issue with typos being copied from theme to theme and realized I did it too); belatedly realized content-single.php was not removed from SVN, even though it was removed from my working copy. Have rolled into content.php to reduce unneeded files\n

= 18 February 2015 =
* Refactor header to avoid empty markup if no widgets or menu is assigned to the header toggle menu area\n
* Align post format icons better with the corresponding text\n
* Removed invalid characters from stylesheet\n
* Updated hover styles; Changed widgets icon; Updated font enqueue function.\n

* Capitalized package names\n
* Capitalized package names\n
* Initial conversion to _s\n
* deleted original theme files in prep to rebuild in _s\n
* Initial commit from .org repo\n
* Only show author panel if this blog has more than one author.\nFor a personal or one-author blog, this panel can become repetitive and unnecessary, so let's nix it!
* Ensure the social menu doesn't have drop-down indicator, even if a menu item has children.\nThis menu really isn't designed to have sub-menus, so it's best that if a user creates one——most likely accidentally——it doesn't appear on the page.

= 15 February 2015 =
* Make sure the logged-out-follow email field is always visible. Ignoring the color annotation and the color contrast. Fixes #2961\n
* Only load Flexslider when it's really needed (Portfolio Page Template)\n
* Minor formatting tweaks: ensure that author panel clears tag list; ensure headings break where necessary, and remove left-hand margins on figure elements.\n
* Remove filtering functions for post frontpage.\nThese functions would select the two most recent featured posts, and move them to the top of the post hierarchy. I think this might be unexpected behaviour here. Since this can be acheived using sticky posts instead, I'd rather leave it to the user to decide how posts should be ordered. This way, the featured post functionality is just about assigning some prominence and visual interest to the grid.

= 14 February 2015 =
* updating available social media icons to include full set available in genericons. No real reason not to, and this level of support seems normal  across other themes\n
* merge with latest core changes up to [wp31464].\n
* merge with latest core changes up to [wp31464].\n

* merge with latest core changes up to [wp31454].\n

= 13 February 2015 =
* Updated clearfix to include gallery wrapper element.\nPreviously floated children elements were preventing container from expanding to full height.
* updating sidebar, content and comments widths to match grid used in portfolio landing page * replacing original styles/functionalty that styled regular menu links as social icons, and replaced with separate menu. This is more consistent with how other themes seem to handle this - rather than having the user enter classes on each link to add the icon, the styles automatically use the URLs if the links are added to the social menu. * updating readme.txt to remove original social icon instructions and add instructions that match current social link setup: No such file or directory\n

= 12 February 2015 =
* Add proper post navigation.\nThis was previously nonexistent. I'm not entirely sure why, but I'd rather give users the option to hide it using custom CSS, rather than having it absent by default.
* Updated alignment styles for full-sized images smaller than 1000px in width.\nPreviously, images below 1000px would unexpectedly left-align. Implemented a CSS transform

= 11 February 2015 =
* updating RTL porfolio styles to match grid issue fix from style.css; fixing validation error\n
* removing narrower content width on pages. Was added to make more consistent with index posts, but on further review is just too disjointed with comments.\n
* fixed float clearing, grid issue with portfolio page display. Improved consistency of portfolio shortcode post meta\n
* Tweak grid for more consistent margins and to separate sidebar from main content a bit.\nThis grid is pretty finicky; it'll require more fine-tuning later.

= 10 February 2015 =
* Fix input/select overflow by adding a max-width\n
* Set eol-style to native for all text files.\n
* Add proper archive page & shim copied from _s.\n
* Adjust post dates on archive pages to overlap thumbnail image.\nThis makes it a good deal easier to visually track which post goes with which headline, de-emphasizes the date information a smidge, and makes the page feel a bit less busy.
* Add placeholder images for posts with no featured images.\nThese images will need to be tweaked once thumbnail sizes are final.
* Make sure that nav li's don't have any unnecessary padding.\n
* Add more context to strings (Continue reading, Read more) stating that only screen readers will display the post/page title\n

= 9 February 2015 =
* Style footer widgets.\nFor the time being, I've made these widgets center-aligned, although I'm not sure that's the best choice given the strong left-alignment of the overall design. This just feels like the most balanced way to display widgets here, particularly on large screens. Might be worth revisiting & tweaking later in the process.
* Improve styling of sidebar.\nIn short: elements should line up more consistently, table links shouldn't be underlined (because it looks weird), and typefaces/line-height for non-primary sidebar should be smaller, so the sidebar won't end up all over the place.
* Improve display of blockquotes and quote elements.\nRestyle blockquotes so they're a bit more modern in feel, to fit with the overall theme.
* Ensure that <code> and <pre> and their ilk are all at a visible size.\n
* Style lists, and particularly nested lists, better.\n
* Restyle author panel to have a bit more emphasis.\n
* Remove author panel from pages.\n

= 8 February 2015 =
* tidied and updated changelog; reformatted theme information to FAQ format used by other themes. Added information about portfolio post types and set up from Illustratr\n
* notice no newline message when running diff; checked _s and other themes to verify, then added new line at end of each file for consistency. Minor spacing fixes in rtl.css\n
* adding esc_url to get_permalink in function that displays post meta information; wrapping functions that output author, date, categories and tags in if ! function_exists() check so they can be modified\n
* updating widget IDs to sidebar-1, sidebar-2, sidebar-3 - the first is to maximize compatability with Minileven based on Caroline's recommendation; the other two for naming consistency\n
* updating page width, alignment to match index.php view; tweaking spacing around elements for consistency\n
* re-adding page_menu_args function; realizing it just affected fallback menu (dur)\n

= 7 February 2015 =
* fixing spacing discrepancies in headers, font sizing, between website and editor\n
* making minor improvement after cross browser, small screen testing\n
* Clean up inline post controls.\nVisual tweaks + removing elements that didn't seem strictly necessary (the anchor link, for example).
* fixing comments, table cell alignment in RTL styles\n
* creating styles for RTL based on style.css\n
* Adding prev next link arrows to styles; adjusting infiniate scrolling spinner to position closer to older posts link and to center\n
* removing inline arrows so they can be added by CSS and switched for RTL\n
* removing inline arrows from prev/next links; moving to CSS so can be switched for RTL\n
* missed Audio post format - adding\n
* Register a size for featured images, and use it in post listing pages.\nResizing with CSS seems like a messier way of doing this, so we're sizing the actual images themselves, instead.
* Remove "related content" functionality.\nWordPress.com already has this feature, so we should use the built-in functionality rather than reinventing the wheel here.
* fixing minor formatting issues discovered while creating rtl.css styles\n
* Use extends within SCSS for cleaner CSS output and easier maintainability of reusable elements.\n
* Add Masonry and ImagesLoaded libraries.\nThese should have been checked in with #23534, but someone wasn't paying attention.
* Add a full-width page template.\nSolves this error: https://wordpress.org/support/topic/fullwidth-page-template
* fixed minor formatting issue in header; fixed line height value in menu toggle\n
* switching title fallback for portfolio pieces from date to View Project - was holdover from this format being used for posts, but dates aren't displayed with portfolio projects\n
* moving contents of changelog into readme.txt to match other themes. Updating readme information to reflect theme updates. Deleting original changelog file\n
* Show tags and entry meta in a consistent manner throughout posts.\n
* Ensure that Masonry is only initiated on pages that strictly need it (so .blog and .archive).\nWhile we're at it, don't have footer inherit from .entry-meta--with our new .entry-meta styles, that just looks frightful.
* removing license file\n
* added regular post, port format styles. Reworked original posts to be used for portfolio and added styles. Fixed header to accommodate long site names. Updated footer styles to center 1 2 or 3 columns. Reordered and numbered headers.\n
* Moved comments to function.php. Added function to display post categories and tags; added snaps_entry_time_author output to this function. Minor formatting tweaks.\n
* added portfolio post type support, and ability to toggle portfolio page content\n
* removed functions that added home to menu, improved nav on image.php, and changed title tag. Added functions for more links, and to remove first gallery from gallery posts\n
* Implement Masonry on post archives for more dynamic appearance.\nWill require a bit of tweaking so it's just right.
* removed styles for admin area to help header display correctly - not needed\n
* Adding wpcom.php to theme - includes theme colours and print style theme support\n
* added logo, responsive video, portfolio support. Added footer widgets to infinite scroll support and updated container\n
* Added clearfix class to #content div; removed conditional code around comment template tag so no comments message would display\n
* Added clearfix class to #content container, updated name of no content template part.\n
* Removed single-statement inline control structure, empty line at end\n
* Removed title tag (unneeded with title-tag theme support); updated header background image inline styles, so it would adjust to fit header title. Updated markup for site title and description. Switched menu toggle to button.\n
* removing sidebar-footer.php - is redundant to sidebar.php and unused. Was possibly added to have a more logical name for sidebar.php, since it is used in footer\n
* adding clearfix class; moving header outside of loop so displays when there's no results; updating name of no content template part\n
* reworking content.php to be used for regular post types (with title, content, post meta and featured image). Original markup ended up used as portfolio post type.\n
* updating screenshot so it's large enough. Used designer's demo site.\n
* Capitalizing Snaps in rtl.css; adding clearfix class to site-content div in page.php\n
* Updated readme to reflect updated social media icons for nav. Had added dribbble, instagram and linkedin\n
* Moving genericons from images directory to own folder in root; updating with latest version\n
* modifying file name for genericons (removing capitals)\n
* optimizing img\n
* Added menu toggle for small screens; support so menu and portfolio project hover will function on touch screen devices. Added function for skip to content in IE9. Removed original menu JS and unneeded function to add class to posts on hover.\n
* removing small-menu.js; simplified functionality and added to scripts.js file\n
* removing HTML5 shiv JS; not required for supported browsers\n
* Removing keyboard-image-navigation.js, as it was just for image.php\n
* Removing unneeded searchform.php, image.php\n
* added theme support for html5, post formats, custom backgrounds; made thumbnail size custom, not default; added setup_author and get_link_url functions; removed snaps_sidebar_styles function and recreated in CSS. Added content width; reordered\n
* removing title attr from WordPress link to make match standard footers (like _s)\n
* adding stylesheet for editor\n
* adding temlate part for Status post format\n
* Adding files for Jetpack porfolio posts. content-portfolio is based off original content files, with fixes to work around massively long post titles, and missing featured images\n
* Included before and after in the_title() tag; added Continue reading text to the_content(); moved 'Edit' link into content area to inherit entry-meta class styles\n
* Renaming 'no-results.php' to 'content-none.php' for file name consistency\n
* Adding template part for Link posts. Uses _get_url_link() and falls back to get_permalink()\n
* Adding template part for Image posts. Only outputs title on single post view\n
* Adding template part for Gallery posts. Includes get_post_gallery() if exists instead of the_post_thumbnail()\n
* fixing single-statement inline control structure; updating comment title  string to match _s\n
* updated to reflect changes to theme\n
* Added _setup_author() function from _s; added headers for portfolio post types; added check to see if portfolio archive, and to use portfolio template part. Updated name of no_results template part.\n
* adding recent posts, categories, archives to 404 error page\n
* Show featured content at double-size, using CSS only.\nThis currently works well on mobile (since there are no issues with nth-child), but might benefit from implenting Masonry or similar for display on larger screens, since the grid breaks like it's going out of style.
* initial commit to /pub\n
* Commit empty folder to /dev to work around weird 409 permissions error; trying this to see if Laurel can upload her files directly to this folder.\n
* Rearrange list of posts on homepage and archive into proper grids. Tweak typography.\n

= 6 February 2015 =
* Fix faulty variable references in SCSS files.\n(Bad Sarah.)
* Implement Susy as a grid framework.\nThis will allow the theme to be aligned to a consistent grid throughout, without all that complicated adding and subtracting!
* Make sure we don't try to run mobile nav js on larger devices.\nIdeally we'd like parent menu items to be clickable on larger screens.
* Improve display of sub-menus on tablets and larger screens.\nEffectively resolves this: https://wordpress.org/support/topic/sub-levels-doesnt-work-in-navigation
* Get sub-menus functional, at least mobile.\nThey aren't very pretty yet, so that'll need some work.

= 5 February 2015 =
* Add a max-width to gallery images/links to make sure it doesn't overflow\n

= 16 March 2013 =
* Revert part of [13255] that added authors back into `twentyten_posted_on`. This merge caused duplicate authors to show up in Twenty Ten and its child themes on WordPress.com. The reason `twentyten_posted_by` was initially added into the theme on .com was because of #384, but then it was later decided on the Theme Dev P2 to show authors even on single-author blogs. Thus, `twentyten_posted_by` is still useful for the sake of not showing authors on author archives, but I imagine a case could be made to ditch `twentyten_posted_by` altogether to avoid future Twenty Ten merge issues with .org and .com. See #1641.\n

* Fix issues with line-height on post titles and redesign comments.\n
* Add masonry.resize so that onResize option is available for use. Ref. https://github.com/desandro/masonry/pull/218\n
* Update Masonry to version 2.1.05\n
* Add a `current_user_can( 'publish_posts' )` check to no-results.php because there's no point in displaying a "publish your first post" promo to users that don't have the ability to publish posts. Also remove a similar condition from index.php because we don't need it anymore.\n
* Fix issue where color previews would assume the presence of the toolbar.\n
* Removing auto width on captioned images inside the images widget because it was causing the image to fill the entire caption background area.\n
* Adding a '1' to the check for is_rtl(). This fixes an issue where posts were loading right to left even for ltr users. Fixes #1453.\n

= 22 October 2012 =
* Make sure that Masonry works on all sites. See #1452.  * Conditionally load only part of load-more-posts.js if $wp_query->max_num_pages is greater than one.\n
* Theme's javascript is dependent on Masonry. Fixes #1452  * Move inlive javascript blocks from index.php, archive.php, and footer.php into lib/load-more-posts.js.  * Enqueue load-more-posts.js listing masonry.js as a dependency.  * Define global javascript object Imbalance2 to hold php configuration values.  * Remove unsed (I think) $color variable.\n
* Update PRE tag to look better for poetry, which is what this theme was originally designed for. The PRE tag will preserve spacing in poems.\n
* Provide an image-widget specific adjustment to fix an issue where captioned images inside the image widget would break out of the caption bounding box, props @kobendland. Also changed the maximum width for wp-caption to 100% instead of a hard-coded pixel value, because that was preventing captioned images from having the correct width inside widgets.\n
* Lower some unnecessarily high z-indexes to prevent certain plugins from appearing underneath content. Removed gallery spacing styles since I'm not sure we can use them with tiled galleries now.\n
* Updated screenshot to include navigation menu.\n
* Minor tweak to author archives text style, unnecessary font color attribute.\n
* Improve tag/cat link margins so they're nice even when only one category is used.\n
* Fixes for Gravatar hovercards -- since the body is absolutely positioned we need to account for the admin bar when it's visible. Also need to ensure hovercards appear above the content. Add transitions for Opera-based browsers. Add dates to enqueued scripts.\n
* Replace pipe separating tags and categories with icons for each type.\n
* CSS tweaks, updated screenshot, updated tags and description in style.css, add .hentry class to no-results to improve display.\n

= 21 October 2012 =
* Adding to .ignore\n
* Initial import.\n

= 20 October 2012 =
* Move on to Masonry plugin - second path of displaying ajax post and animation.\n* Try to use Masonry plugin instead of Grid-A-Licious plugin.
* Clearfix #main; add wrapper to tertiary sidebar and colophon to prevent lined background from showing through on the sides of these elements; remove overflow:auto property from #main which was causing a horizontal scroll bar to appear.\n
* Minor tweaks to header spacing; use a clearfix instead of display inline-block to fix a Safari bug with the red borders alignment.\n
* Prevent large images from overflowing the content area.\n

= 19 October 2012 =
* Better way to fetch contents via ajax. This avoids to load admin-ajax.php. Props @michaelfields.\n
* Fix bug in IE/Firefox for Windows where the post title gets cut off at the top when using custom fonts and a large font size. Added a z-index to the post title to ensure it displays over other content and does not get cut off. Fixes #1447\n
* First pass of displaying  contents via ajax. Commiting this for peer sanity check.\n
* initial import from wporg repo\n
* Fix bug in which featured images on single post view overflow the content area when viewing on small screens (iPad in particular)\n
* Fetching posts via ajax.\n

* Initial import from local dev.\n
* Add Kyoto and remove Runo Lite from ignore list\n
* fix the slider, which would display posts even if there were no sticky/featured posts\nThis happened because `sight_featuring_posts()` returned false when there were no featured posts and as a result
* Tweaks to header styles; removed fonts directory, which contained styles specific to Cyrillic fonts only useful to self-hosted sites.\n

= 17 October 2012 =
* Only output the permalink HTML once. Conditionally add the "printer-only" class for the singular view.\n
* Fix wrong text domain.\n
* Remove "Comments are closed" messages from home page view; change single pages to display the message only if there are existing comments. Fixes #1350\n
* Fix text transform and letter spacing on post comments button.\n
* \n* Fix the portfolio page template query. It was originally pulling back 24 posts regardless of format or featured image size, then using if statements to check the resulting query for these conditions and displaying whatever posts were left. This resulted in less than the expected 24 posts from displaying. Created a new query that looks for the required post formats, featured images, and excludes images with featured image sizes that are too small. This has the expected effect of returning up to 24 recent posts with the correct criteria.
* Fix bug with navigation search form padding I introduced in r11256\n
* Replace uses of $post->guid with wp_get_attachment_url(). See #1169\n
* Replace use of ->guid with wp_get_attachment_url(). To do this I modified the custom query to return the post ID instead of the guid. See #1169\n
* Replaced $post->guid with wp_get_attachment_url(). See #1169\n
* Sandbox 1.6.1: Replaced $post->guid with wp_get_attachment_url(). See #1169\n

* Replace use of $post->guid with wp_get_attachment_url(); See #1169\n
* Make some global properties (form tags, body text alignment, and paragraph margins) more specific with the #container class so they don't affect elements outside the container, like the WP.com Follow form.\n

= 16 October 2012 =
* Multiple changes: * Make comment author font size a bit bigger * Prevent submenu links from overflowing their containers * Dark backgrounds showed through the paper background on non-retina displays, so changed the background color to white to fix.\n
* Multiple changes: * Remove post date from sticky posts on the home page * Delete README.md * Add load_text_domain() * Remove support for post-thumbnails since this theme does not use theme * Remove extra TinyMCE buttons * Remove footnotes shortcode * Tighten up description in style.css * Add wpcom.php with themecolors array and dequeue_fonts function * Fixed credit link in the footer\n
* Re-add load_theme_textdomain() for Extend. Thanks for the tip @michaelfields!\n
* Changes to custom headers: * Change min-height of #masthead hgroup (which has the custom header applied as a background image) to match the height of the custom header image, allowing the image to be a flexible height as intended without getting cut off at the bottom. Fixes #1434 * Change background-size property from cover to contain, and apply only to smaller screen sizes using a media query, to prevent custom header from stretching at screen widths greater than 890px.\n
* Add option to remove baby graphic. Fixes #1444. Also removed refs to language directory since it's not needed for .com.\n
* Remove leading and trailing whitespace from translated strings to avoid these spaces getting lost in translation (:)) Fixes #1446\n

= 15 October 2012 =
* Fixed custom header width from 188px to 180px, as that's the actual available content width in the sidebar.\n
* Changes to make featured images and custom header more consistent. * Set Hum's suggested custom header height to 200px, since the max-height on the sidebar logo is also 200px. * The featured image post thumbnail size, which was originally set to 288px high as per Twenty Eleven's recommended custom header size, will also be 200px now. This should prevent the featured image from changing proportions due to the max-height:200px property.\n
* Change search box on 404 and .search-no-results to better match with the rest of the theme.\n
* Set post date color to gray when using the Dark or Blue color schemes, so the ribbon color doesn't clash with the date color.\n
* Force comment notification labels to be black in color. They're currently white, which makes them illegible on the light background. Fixes #1410\n
* Change bg color in themecolors from dark to white so LaTeX images will display properly. Fixes #1405\n
* Remove actions and filters for Twenty Eleven's link color, color scheme, and layout theme options, so user's previous settings don't effect Hum. Fixes #1430\n
* Update Google Fonts link to include the Extended Latin character subset, which was excluded from the original API. This fixes #1414.\n
* Adjust content_width from 525px to 388px, since the only place this value is used is on the home page in the featured post (first post/sticky post) area. The content_width for single posts/pages is correct, but the home page will only ever have 388px of available space for the first post, due to the author avatar information at the top. Subsequent posts use a template part that does not display any content at all. This fixes tiled galleries in the featured post area.\n
* Tweaks to .featured-gallery styles such that they don't interfere with the new tiled galleries should users choose this option in Settings -> Media.\n

= 14 October 2012 =

* Change search page's output from entry-summary to entry-content so that custom colors and text looks proper.\n
* Add a mobile-theme class to the body to allow Minileven to be targeted with Custom CSS in JetPack. Before, there was no way to target Minileven for CSS without also affecting the desktop theme. See #1418.\n
* use wp_get_theme() instead of get_current_theme() because latter is deprecated since 3.4 and also because it was returning the parent theme name.\n

* Twenty Eleven's .left-sidebar class was causing the post area on the blog/single/archive views to be narrower than it should be. Also noticed the same class would cause the main sidebar to float underneath the content, so added more specific styles to the #secondary and #content IDs.\n

* Remove function to change content_width for full-width page template; instead, set the variable directly in page-nosidebar.php. This helps tiled galleries to work for both sizes.\n

* Let's add a replacement sidebar.php that does not include any fallback widgets should the user choose not to configure their own. Keeps it simpler while still retaining the use of Main Sidebar if desired.\n
* On second thought, let's just support the Main Sidebar, not rename it and have it only available on one page template. Much less confusing this way.\n
* re-enabling add_image_size; props kobenland\n
* Delete sidebar-page.php from child theme as it has not changed from the parent theme. Tweak to @todo note in functions.php\n
* In order to incorporate the Sidebar Template into this child theme (since it can't yet be removed due to a lack of filters on page templates) I've renamed it to Page Sidebar to better reflect its use.
